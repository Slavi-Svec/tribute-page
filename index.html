            <h3 id="tribute-info">David Brent is a fictional character in the BBC television mockumentary
               The Office, portrayed by the show's co-creator, co-writer and co-director Ricky Gervais.
               Brent is a white-collar office middle-manager and the principal character of the series.
                He is the general manager of the Slough branch of Wernham-Hogg paper merchants and the boss
                 to most other characters in the series. Much of the comedy of the series centres on Brent's many
                 idiosyncrasies, hypocrisies, self-delusions and overt self-promotion.

            <h3 id="tribute-info">
               Brent has a tendency to promote himself as an intelligent and politically correct man, but often
               demonstrates an unwittingly offensive attitude towards ethnic minorities, disabled people and women. However, as cringeworthy
               and insulting as his attitudes and faux pas can be, the insults are rarely intended maliciously; they are frequently the result
               of extreme naivety and self-delusion and they are spoken in the wrong place at the wrong time.
